# logo-maker

## Description

Many people, like developers, avoid writting the same code over and over again. More so, they like to write code to save time. This project saves time for anyone wanting to make a simple logo. The user simply answers a few prompt questions about how they want their logo and the code will make a logo with that information in an svg file. Freelancers need to add a logo to their projects to cement their work but do not want to spend extra hours making one from scratch. This is why I built this project. Through this project, I learned to be organized with my files and how node javascript and tests work together.
